# Repo_ClimateSoil_TraitSpectrum
This is the repository for the paper "Climatic and soil factors explain the two-dimensional spectrum of global plant trait variation" (Joswig et al. 2021).

It is split into two folders that contain a readme for themselves: 
1. Main, covering the main analyses as in the main paper.
2. Supplement, covering the analyses of the supplement.
