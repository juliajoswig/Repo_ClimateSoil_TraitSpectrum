<dt>Date: 11-Jan-2001 (process 1 of 1)
<dd>
The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the features from ESRI Data &amp; Maps 1999 data set-admin98.shp.  Updated political boundaries for countries and first-level administrative units.  Used Continent attribute to dissolve out the necessary features to create the continents. Removed unnecessary attributes. Created ArcGIS™ layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Created spatial indices.

<li><A NAME="quality.5"><b>How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including topology?</b></A><p>
No duplicate features are present.  The shapefile is created directly from a topologically correct ArcInfo™ coverage.
