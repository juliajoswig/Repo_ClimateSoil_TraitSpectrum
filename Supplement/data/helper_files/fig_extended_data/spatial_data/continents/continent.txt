Updated political boundaries for countries and first-level administrative units.  Used Continent attribute to dissolve out the necessary features to create the continents. Removed unnecessary attributes. Created ArcGIS™ layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Created spatial indices.
